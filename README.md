# emma
A simple randomly generated dungeon crawler

# setup
* Download nodejs and npm
* Install a web server to host the game (I use npm's http-server for development)
* Install of the dependencies via npm (`npm install`)
* Compile the game (`npm run compile`) or create a binary version with (`npm run binary`)

# to do for first release
* Combat (and equipment)
* Starter quests
* More items
* Chests and random loot
* Skill tree
* Game notifications (such as 'You have just picked up 5 coins' etc)
* Visual, interactive inventory system
* Better enemy pathfinding (smaller nodes, less tile to tile)
